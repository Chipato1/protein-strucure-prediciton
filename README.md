# protein-strucure-prediciton
A few scripts implement and evaluate several classical structure-prediction approaches from the literature.
I classified the approaches into "simple" and "advanced". They all use conventional methods and no form of learning is implemented.
It helps a lot to get a feeling for the problem. I put some comments into the py files.

The next step from here will be to look into ML solutions. The implementations here could serve as some solid baselines.
